I have put in both my medical diagnosis programs. The second one has more efficient and detailed code than its previous version. 
I created the second one a little after studying methods and functions in detail in 11th grade, and made sure to include that to make it more structure and organized.
I consulted various specialists like neurosurgeons, a dermatologist, my mother(a dentist), and more for every part of the program to prevent any reliability issues.
These programs provide a quicker way to find out what possible disease/illness you're facing. 
They are, however, limited to easily detectable diseases.
