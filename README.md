I have put in both my medical diagnosis programs. The second one has more efficient and detailed code than its previous version. 
I created the second one a little after studying methods and functions in detail in 11th grade, and made sure to include that to make it more structure and organized.
I consulted various specialists like neurosurgeons, a dermatologist, my mother(a dentist), and more for every part of the program to prevent any reliability issues.
These programs provide a quicker way to find out what possible disease/illness you're facing. 
They are, however, limited to easily detectable diseases.
To run this program, you can download the code files and put them into BlueJ preferably or any Java code runner. Then, compile the code and run the program.
