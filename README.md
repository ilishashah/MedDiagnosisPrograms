I have built and uploaded two medical diagnosis programs. The second one has more efficient and detailed code than its previous version. 
I created the second one soon after studying methods and functions in greater detail in 11th grade and made sure to include that to make it more structured and organized.
I consulted various specialists like neurosurgeons, a dermatologist, and a dentist for every part of the program to prevent reliability issues. 
These programs provide a faster way to detect a disease/illness. 
They are currently limited to easily detectable diseases. 
To run this program, you can download the code files and put them into BlueJ preferably or any Java code runner. Then, compile the code and run the program.
